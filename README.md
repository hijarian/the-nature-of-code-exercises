Exercises from the book The Nature of Code, by Daniel Shiffman

The version of the book is the one published in the repo [`nature-of-code/noc-book-2023`](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book-2023) on GitHub.
That version is for P5.js but I don't really care, I started doing the solutions in original Processing (v4), converting on-the-fly is not that hard anyway.

I abhor Javascript so much that I absolutely refuse using it in my pet projects.
No, I'll never get tired of bashing this joke of a language.

Processing have been chosen because it provides a ready-to-use environment with canvas, draw loop, and a keyboard/mouse listener built-in.
It's an interesting idea to switch to C++ when I'll be more comfortable with making such an enviroment by myself (Raylib comes to mind first, also, Cinder exists).
